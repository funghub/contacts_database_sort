# About the Program
**comparefiles.py** is the program that will print out emails that are in Eventbrite but not in Wix and unsubscribed emails in Wix that are in both.

# Background
In Sickle Cell Anemia Awareness, we originally stored contacts to Eventbrite. But, we transfered to using Wix to store the data. We wanted to find out if we accidentally left out contacts in Eventbrite after the transfer to Wix.

Because of that, the goal was to find the emails in Eventbrite.csv not in Wix.csv. This gave us the emails still in Eventbrite but not in Wix.

Then we also looked at emails that were in both Wix.csv and Eventbrite.csv but that may have unsubscribed on Wix now. This gives us contacts who may have unsubscribed after the transfer to Wix but were originally in Eventbrite.
