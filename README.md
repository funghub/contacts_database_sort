Eventbrite is an old platform we used and Wix is more updated. We had some emails on a list from Eventbrite that we didn't know if they were transferred onto Wix.

Because of that, the goal was to find the emails in Eventbrite.csv not in Wix.csv.
Then we also looked at emails that were in both Wix.csv and Eventbrite.csv but that may have unsubscribed on Wix now.
